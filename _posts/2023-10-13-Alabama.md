title: 'Alabama'
---
Like many of the other states in the modern southern-eastern United States, Alabama was home to the wide-ranging Mississippian culture. Some of their descendants formed the Muscogee Creek Confederacy, a related group of peoples in what is now Tennessee, Alabama, and western Georgia. Under the Confederacy, each town had its own mico or leader who held authority only if they could persuade others to agree with their decisions. One of the peoples in the Confederacy was the Alabama, from which the state takes its name. The word itself is a Muscogee word that means “campsite” or “clearing.” After allying with the closely related Coushatta, with whom they intermarried and shared a mutually intelligible language, the two tribes now live in Texas.
