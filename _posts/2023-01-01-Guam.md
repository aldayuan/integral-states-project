title: 'Guam'
---

The people of Guam are descended from Southeast Asia and arrived on the island about 4000 years ago. The Chamorro lived in what is now Guam as well as the Northern Mariana Islands. They used a lunar calendar for planting crops such as sweet potatoes and yams. The Chamorro were expert seafarers and had a stratified society with distinct classes. They raised megalithic pillars called latte stones to serve as support structures for buildings. The latte stones are tall pillars that narrow toward the top and then flare out into a capstone, in a design similar to modern day highway supports. The name of the island comes from the Chamorro word Guahan, which means “what we have.”
