title: 'Utah'
---
People have lived in modern-day Utah for more than 10,000 years, with evidence of settlements particularily in the Escalante Valley. Distinct cultures developed including the Fremont Culture and the Ancestral Puebloans, who built irrigation systems and cliff-side homes for defensive purposes. The Nuuchi-u (“the people” or Ute), from whom the name of the state is taken, lived throughout present day Utah and Colorado though their hunting grounds extended into several neighboring states. The Utes speak Shoshonean, a dialect of Uto-Azetecan and were really a collection of bands. The Paiute are descended from the same migratory group as the Utes and they speak mutually intelligible languages. The Goshute lived in the desert around the Great Salt Lake, wintering in Deep Creek Valley and hunting for game throughout what is now western Utah and eastern Nevada.
