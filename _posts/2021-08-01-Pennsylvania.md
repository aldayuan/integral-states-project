title: 'Pennsylvania'
---
The Monongahela culture established settlements in what is now southwestern Pennsylvania. They cultivated maize and built palisades around their villages with maze-like entrances. Before the Iroquois expanded from the St. Lawrence region, present-day Pennsylvania was mainly populated by Algonquian speaking peoples and Siouan speaking peoples. In addition to the Lenape, the Petun, the Shawnee, the Susquehannock, and the Erie peoples all called the area home. The Petun closely associated with the Wendat (Huron Confederacy) and eventually joined with the Huron to form the Wyandot. The Shawnee lived through the Ohio River Valley, occupying parts of Ohio, Kentucky as well as the Virginias, Pennsylvania and Maryland. The Susquehannock, an Iroquian speaking people, originated in what is now New York. The Erie originated on the banks of the lake but conflict with the Iroquois drove them further inland to Pennsylvania.
