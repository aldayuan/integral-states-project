Three main cultural groups lived in what is now Virginia: the Iroquoian, the Eastern Siouan and the Algonquian. Each of these cultures consisted of numerous tribes. In eastern Virginia, a chief named Wahunsenacawh created an association of thirty tribes. Colonists named them the Powhatan after the village of Wahunsenacawh, which was likely in the vicinity of present-day Richmond. The Siouan Monacan lived to the west of the Powhatan in dome-shaped homes made of bark and reed. These peoples mined and traded copper to neighboring tribes and buried their dead in mounds. The Iroquoian Tuscarora lived in the western part of the state, migrating from the peninsula that Delaware sits on.
