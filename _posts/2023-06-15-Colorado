title: 'Colorado'
---

Over fourteen thousand years, the peoples who lived in what is now Colorado adapted to changes in climate and the ebb and flow of megafuana. They used ground stone tools to process grains, introduced corn, and changed their movement patterns in response to seasonal changes. More recently, the Apache, a group of culturally related tribes, lived throughout the American southwest. The term refers to six major Apache-speaking groups: Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Plains Apache, and Western Apache. The Arapaho and Cheyenne, both Algonquian speaking peoples, moved west to the region that now encompasses Colorado. The tribes banded together as allies and some members of the tribes are now one people in Oklahoma.
