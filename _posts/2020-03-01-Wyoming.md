Human habitation of the land that is now Wyoming stretches back at least 13,000 years. People who lived in this area participated in a continental trading network that stretched at least to the Hopewell culture in what is now southern Ohio. The state is named after Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, which itself comes from the Munsee Delaware word which means “at the big river flat.” Many tribes call Wyoming their ancestral home including the Apsaalooke (Crow), Shoshone and Cheyenne. The Apsaalooke lived in the Yellowstone River Valley and adopted the horse, allowing them to hunt buffalo more effectively. The Eastern Shoshone have lived in the Wind River mountain range for 12,000 years. The Cheyenne are an Algonquian speaking people and are compromised of two tribes, the Suhtai and the Tsitsistas.
